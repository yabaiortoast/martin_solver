* TODO program martin solver
  - [x] make a graph dictionary 
  - [x] set up checker (checker(...)) with backtracking and recursion
  - [x] set up solver(...) 
  - [x] print solution

# stuff to learn
- python lists and dictionaries to model #'s and a graph
- python assignment checkers 
- python functions and recursion
- backtracking basics
- basic printing/formatting

p.s. the test.py file is unrelated to the actual project, it was just me messing around with different function parameters and arguments
